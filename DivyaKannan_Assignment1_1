My name is Divya Kannan. I am a graduate student in the Master of Information Management (MIM) program at the iSchool. I have a little experience in coding using HTML and CSS. I learned the basics from Codecademy a few years ago. I am very excited to learn it fully in this class. I am already enjoying this class.

I am currently working as a Quality Assurance (QA) tester and helpdesk support for a small company that does contracting work for the Federal Aviation Administration. I enjoy my work and I hope to use the skills I have learned in the MIM program to do more interesting work and contribute more to my team. 

My hobbies are swimming, reading, traveling, and dancing. I am teaching my friend to swim and I enjoy that as much as swimming myself. My two favorite genre of books to read are period mysteries (ex. generally set in Victorian era London) and self help books. I love dogs but I do not have a dog right now. 

My favorite food items include tacos, quesadilla, pizza, chocolate cakes, and chicken biriyani.
